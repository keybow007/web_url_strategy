WebUrlStrategy inspired by url_strategy

"url_strategy" package has not been maintained for more than 2 years and seems to cause problems since Flutter 3.10 (Dart3), so I created my own package.

## Features

Package for Flutter apps that allows setting the web URL strategy with a single line of code.

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
